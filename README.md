## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to compare NBA players through the use of unsupervised machine learning models by comparing statistical outputs from the 2019-2020 NBA season before the shutdown due to COVID-19. The analysis performed aims to cluster the players to identify how the players are similar and different from statistical perspectives. A secondary goal of the project is to enhance my skills and understanding of various unsupervised machine learning models. Through this analysis, we can quickly identify which players are most like each other in terms of play as well as which statistical variables are most significant in clustering and comparing the players.

## Data Overview
The data sets used are taken directly from nba.com and basketball-reference.com. Thew traditional and advanced statistics as well as the defensive statistics are taken directly from nba.com through manual export and the scoring statistics data set was taken from basketball=reference.com through an export of a csv file.

## Final Output
The PowerPoint presentation contains final findings such as model outputs, cost savings totals, and recommendations/insights.
