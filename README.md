## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to compare NBA players through the use of unsupervised machine learning models by comparing statistical outputs from the 2019-2020 NBA season before the shutdown due to COVID-19. The analysis performed aimed to cluster the players to identify how the players are similar and different from statistical perspectives. A secondary goal of the project is to enhance my skills and understanding of various unsupervised machine learning models. Through this analysis, we can quickly identify which players are most like each other in terms of play as well as which statistical variables are most significant in clustering and comparing the players.

## Project Description
As a basketball fan my entire life, I have engaged in many conversations about comparisons of NBA players. This analysis allows to do exactly this through statistical analyses. If you have ever wondered what player is most similar to LeBron James, or which statistical outputs are most important when grouping players, then this project is for you. There are several eye-opening player comparisons that i would have never expected and kept me entertained throughout this project with the various statistical clusters created.

## Data Overview
The data sets used are taken directly from nba.com and basketball-reference.com. The traditional and advanced statistics as well as the defensive statistics are taken directly from nba.com through manual export and the scoring statistics data set was taken from basketball=reference.com through an export of a csv file.

## Final Output
The PowerPoint presentation contains final findings such as model outputs, cost savings totals, and recommendations/insights.
